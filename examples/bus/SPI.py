NI ELVIS III Serial Peripheral Interface Example
This example illustrates how to write data to or read data from a Serial
Peripheral Interface (SPI) slave device through the SPI channels on the NI
ELVIS III. The program first defines the configuration for the SPI
channels, and then writes to and reads from the device. Each time the write
function is called, a list of data is written to the SPI device; each time the
read function is called, a list of data is returned from the SPI device.

The SPI configuration consists of six parameters: frequency, bank, clock_phase,
clock_polarity data_direction, and frame_length. There are two identical banks
of SPI port (A and B). You can configure the port as follows:
    Frequency: 40Hz to 4000000Hz
    Clock phase: leading and trailing
    Clock polaritie: low and high
    Direction: LSB and MSB
    Frame length: 4 to 16

This example uses ADXL345 as the slave device. ADXL345 requires a 8-bit data
with a 7-bit slave address and a writing/reading bit. The bit 7 refers to the
writing/reading bit. We want to read from the address 0x00, which means we have
to set the bit 7 of 0x00 to 1. The 0x80 hexadecimal data sent from the master
device requests the slave device to send back a default device code which is
equal to 'E5' in hexadecimal or '229' in decimal. This returned value is used
for validation. All the SPI configuration is set correctly and the connection
is functioning correctly if the device ID 'E5' is returned.

See http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf
for more details about ADXL345.

The program performs two different acquisitions by using the write/read
functions. Section 1 demonstrates how to use the write function and the read
function separately. Section 2 demonstrates how to use the writeread function
to write to and read from the SPI channel.

This example uses:
    1. Bank A, SPI.CS.
    2. Bank A, SPI.CLK.
    3. Bank A, SPI.MISO.
    4. Bank A, SPI.MOSI.

Hardware setup:
    1. Connect SPI.CS (DIO0) on bank A to SPI.CS of a slave device.
    2. Connect SPI.CLK (DIO5) on bank A to SPI.CLK of a slave device.
    3. Connect SPI.MISO (DIO6) on bank A to SPI.MOSI of a slave device.
    4. Connect SPI.MOSI (DIO7) on bank A to SPI.MISO of a slave device.
    5. Connect Vcc (+3.3V) of Bank A to Vcc of a slave device.
    6. Connect DGND of Bank A to GND of a slave device.

Result:
    The program writes 0x80, which specifies the address to read from, to the
    SPI device. Then the program reads back a value from the 0x00 register of
    the SPI device. The returned value in section 2 is E5 in hexadecimal; and
    it is ??E5 in section 2.
