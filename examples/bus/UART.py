NI ELVIS III Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter Example
This example illustrates how to write data to or read data from a Universal
Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) device through the UART channels on
the NI ELVIS III. The program first defines the configuration for the UART
channels, and then writes to and reads from the UART device. Each time the
write function is called, a string is written to the UART device; each time
the read function is called, a string is returned from the UART device.

The UART configuration consists of six parameters: bank, baud_rate, data_bits,
stop_bits, parity, and flow_control. There are two identical banks of UART
port, A and B. You can configure the port as follows:
    Baud rates: 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600,
                115200, and 230400
    Data bits: 7 and 8
    Stop bits: one and two
    Parity: none, odd, and even
    Flow Controls: None, XON/XOFF, RTS/CTS, and DTR/DSR

This example illustrates how to write to and read from a UART device, FTDI232.
See http://www.ftdichip.com/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT232R.pdf for more
details.

This example uses:
    1. Bank A, UART.RX.
    2. Bank A, UART.TX.

Hardware setup:
    1. Connect UART.RX (DIO16) on bank A to UART.TX of a UART device.
    2. Connect UART.TX (DIO17) on bank A to UART.RX of a UART device.
    3. Connect DGND on bank A to GND of a UART device.

Result:
    The program writes the string 'Hello World' to the UART device, and
    reads back five bytes of data from the device.
